This is the virtual keyboard made by using mediapipe and opencv library. It firstly takes image 
from webcam in real time and on the basis of that detect hand points and we can consider press when middle 
and index finger comes closer. Basically it measures the distance between the middle and index finger

When index finger is over any key it becomes darker to understand and when we cross index and 
middle finger it consider it as a click and turn the button into green.
